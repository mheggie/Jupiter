# Jupiter
A BlazorServer app for the creation and resolution of design issues in the building and construction industry.

One of my frustrations as a Client side Project Manager is the management and close-out of issues at design stage. Our situation is this:

* We engage a Contractor to design and construct a new facility.
* The Contractor engages a number of consultants and subcontractors to prepare the design for them.
* At approximately 50%, 90% and 100% stages the Contractor will submit the design to us for review.
* We pass it onto our Review consultants to review on our behalf.
* Our reviews check the design drawings and return a list of issues for the Contractor to fix or respond to.
* We pass on the issues list to the contractor, they send it onto their Consultants.
* The Consultants respond with updated drawings or comments in the issues list and it goes back to our reviewers again.
* Back and forth a number of times until hopefully the design is finalised and all issues are resolved.

We typically use excel for the issues list and trying to keep track of the list accross multiple designers and peer reviewers, all sending comments at different times is really cumbersome.

Jupitor is intended to solve this frustration but being the sole source of truth for all design issues.

Issues and responses are linked so that they can be read as a conversation, to resolution.

Conslutants and Reviewers only need to see issues relevant to their "Package", but Clients & Contractors to monitor issues accross all "Packages" for the entire project.

I'm a construction project manager not a software developer. I'm doing this for fun and my own use.

If you want to help me make it happen drop me a line.
